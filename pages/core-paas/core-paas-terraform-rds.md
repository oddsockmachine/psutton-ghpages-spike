# RDS - Terraform best practices

Here are the best practices we recommend when creating and RDS instance from within our Kubernetes AWS accounts. To retrieve the randomly generated password, please contact a member of the Core PaaS team and we will retrieve it from the vault. We are working on a better way of handling these secrets. Please *do not* create DNS entries for these endpoints as we will want to migrate to use TLS in the future.
